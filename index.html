      <h2>Talks</h2>
      <h3>Strategy: Designing a Small Business</h3>
      <h4>Presented by Leta Sobierajski & Wade Jeffree</h4>
      <p>Description: Marketing plans, financial reports and contracts are not what
        creative dreams are made of. But they are an integral part of any small
        business. How do you achieve success establishing and maintaining a small
        design studio? How do you define success over the short and long-term of a
        studio’s existence? Join three sets of owners of acclaimed creative
        boutique as they describe their journeys and offer insights from what
        they’ve learned along the way and then answer audience questions.</p>
      <h3>Content Design: Why There's Another Title in Our Industry</h3>
      <h4>Presented by Sarah Richardson</h4>
      <p>Copywriter, UX writer, technical author, web editor... it's slightly
        ironic an industry of wordsmiths have so many titles for themselves. Then,
        in 2011 Sarah Richards created the term 'Content Design' for the
        Government Digital service and added another term to the industry lexicon.
        It caused a lot of consternation in government at the time. Which was the
        point. The reason was quite clear: government had to change the way it
        considered the skill of communicating. GOV.UK was not mucking around.
        Sarah will explain why changing the name was important at the time, the
        process of content design, the impact it has and how it has changed
        content production around the world. Sarah will share examples of how a
        single word can stop a multi-million pound service dead in its tracks, why
        you should have a content person at discovery and how content can make or
        break service design.</p>
      <h3>Design for the Modern Ages</h3>
      <h4>Presented by Professor Elizabeth Guffrey</h4>
      <p>Professor Guffey will be delivering a presentation on design as it has
        evolved throughout not only her career but also the farther past. Ending
        the presentation with a topic of how designers can change today to adapt
        to modern design practices, etc. How can we adapt design to be more
        inclusive and considerate of separate groups? How can design be used to
        help improve our society, and more.</p>
